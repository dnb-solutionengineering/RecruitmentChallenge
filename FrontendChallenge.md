# D&amp;B Solution Engineering Frontend Challenge

Thank you for taking the time to do our technical test. It consists of two parts:

* A coding test
* A few technical questions

In order to avoid bounced emails, we would like you to submit your results by uploading the relevant ZIP file to a shared web accessible storage folder on Microsoft OneDrive. In order to obtain the URL for this folder, please supply your email address to either your agent or the D&B member of staff who assigned you the test.

Please make this a single zip file named {yourname}-{role-applied-for}.zip containing:

1. A single markdown file with the answers to the technical questions
2. One folder containing the technical test

## Coding Exercise:
* Create a web application using Vue.js (https://vuejs.org/) that hits an API (in this case Bitcoin prices in real-time - see Technical Specs below) and display corresponding results.
* Display each currency denomination's Last, Buy and Sell price from blockchain.info service (see Technical Specs below)
* Add a button to query for fresh data.
* Use at least one element from D&B's product design guide: https://productdesign.dnb.com/developers/
* Use some the existing D&B product stylesheet to make your application feel right at home in the D&B family (see Technical Specs below).
* Use at least one CSS transition
* Show off your responsive know-how by hiding/displaying something only at a specific view size defined by you.
